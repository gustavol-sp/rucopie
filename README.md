# RucoPie

:warning: This is in early development stages

RucoPie is a sweet, easy to use alternative to systems like [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/), [Lakka](https://www.lakka.tv/) or [Recalbox](https://www.recalbox.com/). It targets Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 devices to be used via HDMI.

## Features

* Fast boot, built on top of [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/)
* Support for pretty much every Libretro emulator

* Flexible theme system
  * Multi-layer, dynamic backgrounds
  * Per-theme icons
  * Per-theme sounds/music
  * Other tweaks for opacity, shadows and sizing
* Color palette editor
* Heavy operations (file reading/writing, large data processing) are asynchronous
* Pixel-perfect UI in any resolution that is a multiple of 640x360, such as:  
  * Standard HD (1280x720)
  * Full HD (1920x1080)
  * WQHD (2560x1440)
  * 4K UHD (3840x2160)

## How to try this out:

* Install DietPi on your Raspberry Pi and start the system
* Connect to the Internet and enable Onboard Wifi
* Enable automatic boot
* Set OpenSSH as default SSH server with ```dietpi-software``` (this is for roms transferring)
* Run the following script and follow the steps

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tavuntu/rucopie-bkp/main/setup.sh | bash -s
```

* Reboot, and it should be ready to go!

## Things to do/fix:

* Integer coordinates for background to behave smootly
* filesystem speed (add LFS)  (done)
* Persist optimal resolutions for cores and general preferences (done)
* Support joysticks via USB (done-ish)
* Wireless internet conexion screen (in progress)
* More video options (in progress)
